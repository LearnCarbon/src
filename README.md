# LearnCarbon
Empower the architects for  analysing the relationship between structure & embodied carbon in early design stages!

Looking at all the new construction that is projected to take place between now and 2040, we see the critical role embodied carbon plays.
The opportunity to change the embodied material decreases as the project progresses, since each change has a direct impact on the project cost.

LearnCarbon is a Rhino plugin that integrates two machine learning models:
* **Model A**: inputs a conceptual massing model by just a click and gathers data on the area, total built-up, structure type and predicts the Global Warming Potential
* **Model B**: inputs area, total built-up, target GWP value and predicts the suitable structure.


## Prerequisites
* **pandas**: required to read the library.
* **numpy**: required for the matrix calculations
* **matplotlib**: Required for the data visualization.
* **tensorflow**: An end-to-end open source machine learning platform.
* **scikit-learn**: Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.
* **Joblib**: A set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python
* **ghhops_server**: Install ghhops_server
* **flask**: A Python module that lets you develop web applications easily.
* **Altair**: A declarative statistical visualization library for Python.
